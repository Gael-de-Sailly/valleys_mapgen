#    ABOUT SETTINGS

#    Settings are presents twice :
#   -- In every world :
#      world_directory/vmg.conf

#      Format in vmg.conf:
#      flags aren't preceded by "vmg_", like this:

#      version = 2.3
#      water_level = 1

#   -- In the main directory :
#      usually main_directory/minetest.conf

#      Format in minetest.conf:
#      Unlike in vmg.conf, flags are preceded by "vmg_"

#      vmg_version = 2.3
#      vmg_water_level = 1

#    HOW TO CHANGE IT

#    You can simply change it in minetest.conf (will affect new worlds only) or in vmg.conf (will affect the involved world only)
#    But the recent builds (since October 24th 2015) provide a GUI setting system, thanks to PilzAdam, for which Valleys Mapgen has been made compatible.

[General]
#    Valleys Mapgen version used
vmg_version (Version) enum 3.0 3.0

#    Valleys Mapgen logs

#    3 = Detailed mapgen time + trees
vmg_log_level (Log level) int 0 0 3

[Spawn]
#    Maximal distance from (0;0) at which the player will appear
#    if possible (if it's in a big ocean, it might be farther)
vmg_max_distance (Max spawn distance) int 450

#    New players are randomely spawned by the mod
#    disable it to spawn the player another way.
