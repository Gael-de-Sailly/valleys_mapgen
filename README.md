## Changelog
### 1.0 ~> 1.1
* Added caves: they are modelised by 4 3D noises.
* Corrected ores generation: There was too many ores because it was sometimes generated twice or even more.
* Activated versions manager: if you update the mod from 1.0 to this version, the new mapgen will only take effect on new worlds, worlds created with 1.0 will stay in 1.0. If you want to activate mapgen 1.1 in an old world (there could be cleavages), change the file vmg.conf places in the world directory.
* Addedâ€¦ this changelog :-D
